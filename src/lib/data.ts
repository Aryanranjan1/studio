The two main contenders in the modern web development world are traditional CMSs like WordPress and headless CMSs like Strapi or Contentful. A traditional CMS bundles the back-end (content management) and front-end (presentation layer) together, while a headless CMS decouples them, providing content as data via an API. This allows for greater flexibility, better performance, and easier integration across multiple platforms (web, mobile apps, etc.). This article compares the pros and cons of both approaches to help you decide which architecture is the best fit for your project's specific needs.",
