# --- Hosting Cost Estimate ---
# Firebase App Hosting operates on a generous free tier. For a typical
# portfolio website with low to moderate traffic, you can expect the
# hosting costs to be $0 per year.
#
# You only pay for usage that exceeds the free limits. If your site
# becomes very popular, you might incur minimal costs (a few dollars per month).
# You can monitor your usage and set up billing alerts in your
# Google Cloud project dashboard.

runConfig:
  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
  maxInstances: 1
